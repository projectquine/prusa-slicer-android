# prusa-slicer-android

A basic docker-compose setup to allow running PrusaSlicer in docker on top of Termux in android. It requires you have an android device
running termux with docker already setup. It also uses the experimental termux-x11 app for xorg display. 

You can see a demo of it running here: https://twitter.com/ProjectQuine/status/1633417880313163782
